            <div class="box sticky">
                
                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>
                    The sticky position is useful for making responsive web pages that adjust to be as 
                    pleasant as possible regardless of the platform viewed on.
                </p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>
                    The relative position is useful for making an elemnts position and/or size change
                    based on the elemnts position relative to something else, such as the top or left 
                    sides of the screen(viewport).
                </p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>
                    The fixed position is used to make an element stay glued to a spot regardless of 
                    whether or not the user scrolls. 
                </p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>
                   An element using the absolute position is positioned relative to the nearest 
                   positioned ancestor, as appossed to positioned relative to the viewport. 
                </p>
