            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the 
			importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Using descriptive file names is important because it not 
			only allows you to sort through your files to find the one 
			you need quickly but it also makes the project easier to explain 
			to people who may not know anything about programming.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the 
			application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The size of an image may be changed using a variety of applications. 
			In this specific example I used the "Pixlr" website.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the 
			original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size was 2121x1414 pixels</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify 
			the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was 
			the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? 
			Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>There are a variety of image compression tools, the image compressor I used can be found at https://compressor.io. The original size was 12kb and thew new size is 7kb.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" width="500" height="333">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>I noticed that while the original image file opened without any problems I can't seem to get the new, compressed, file to open. </p>

                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
				<svg width="250" height="250">
					<circle cx="125" cy="125" r="100" stroke="blue" stroke-width="6" fill="purple" />
				</svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used a w3 tutorial to create the above svg graphic.</p>
