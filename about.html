                                <p>The Red Panda is a small red, black, and white mammal native 
                                to the eartern Himalayas as-well as a few parts of china.
                                Red Panda's are largely known for their defense mechanism 
                                where, in the event they get intimidated, they will stand up 
                                on their hind legs and raise their front paws above their head
                                to make themselves appear larger than they are to predators
                                in order to dissuade them from attacking the Red Panda.</p>

                                spend tens of thousands of years evolving just looks like a 
                                toddler asking to be picked up and, as a result, it's not 
                                uncommon for tourists to be attacked by the wild animals they 
                                thought wanted "uppies".</p>
