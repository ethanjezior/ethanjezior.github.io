					<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
					<p>
						The following are common exercises that we encourage 
						our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routines.
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Burpee</dt>
						<dd>
							Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase 
							your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, 
							drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your 
							feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up 
							from a squatted position.
						</dd>
						<dt>Planks</dt>
						<dd>
							Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in 
							a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold 
							the position as long as you can.
						</dd>
						<dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
						<dd>
							Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands 
							on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to 
							your chest and then switch as quickly as your can(as though you 
							are climbing a mountain).
						</dd>
